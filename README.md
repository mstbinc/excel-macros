## Excel Macros

This project contains macros that ease the process of developing PFE reports.

All `.vba` files should be defined in the `src/` directory.
They can be compiled by running the XLSB compiler `BinaryCompile.exe`.

It will produce a `PERSONAL.xlsb` file that can be copied to `%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART`.
